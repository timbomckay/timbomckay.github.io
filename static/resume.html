      <h1 class="text-[2.5em]">A Design Centric, Quality Focused, Front-End Engineer</h1>
      <p>I am a simplifier. I love making things easier for anyone I can help. Whether it's an intuitive architecture
        for maintainable scalability, automating tasks for coworkers, simplifying content management for clients, or
        creating fast &amp; pleasant experiences for users. Outside of work I find ways to simplify my wife's daily
        tasks, researching solutions for my friends out of curiosity, or setting up technical devices for family to
        minimize complexities. At the core of what makes me an exceptional software engineer is the desire to help
        others by creating an enjoyable experience.</p>
      <p>I am a design-centric developer focused on quality products that won't settle for “good enough”. I love working
        with great designers that can focus on their art, as they value my level of care and attention when bringing
        their designs to life. I'm proactive in implementing the look and feel that they've created across the site,
        resulting in less back-and-forth, less meetings, and a greater ROI for the business. I'm independently driven to
        get my work done and favor having a team to collaborate for advice with a new feature or tackling different
        obstacles on the same project for shared growth.</p>
      <h2>Greetings</h2>
      <p>I am a design-centric developer who focuses on quality products, and does not settle for “good enough”. I love
        working with great designers that can focus on their art, and they enjoy working with me for my level of care
        and attention when bringing their designs to life. I'm proactive in implementing the look and feel designers
        create across the site, resulting in less back-and-forth, less meetings, and a greater ROI for the business. I
        am independently driven to get my work done on time and favor having a team to collaborate for advice with a new
        feature or tackling different obstacles on the same project.</p>
      <p>I am a simplifier and problem solver. I love making things easier for anyone I can help. Whether it's intuitive
        architecture to improve maintainability, automating tasks for coworkers, simplifying content management for
        clients, or creating fast & pleasant experiences for users, I enjoy bringing high quality and the beauty of
        simplicity into design. My strong desire and innate ability to help others by creating an enjoyable experience
        is what makes me an excellent front-end developer.</p>
      <h2>Aspirations</h2>
      <p>I am searching for a workplace that is looking ahead. One that's able to meet the needs of a product with the
        ability to adapt to the constant changes in the industry. One that's moving forward with emerging technology as
        well as workplace environment. A place to collaborate with a team that strives to push each other forward,
        learning new technologies that help us deliver a better product and increase productivity.</p>
      <p>I love what I do and can't get enough of it. Every project is a new opportunity to learn, and I want to grow my
        talents to expand my skill set.</p>
