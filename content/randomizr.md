A few years ago my brother was contemplating a way to keep the kids attention when opening Christmas gifts, because when we go in order from youngest to oldest the 4-10 year olds are done and restless before the other half of the family. This discussion was held on Christmas Eve at maybe 9pm and my curiosity got the better of me. Determined to have a proof of concept to use the night of Christmas Day, I stayed up until 5am to create Randomizr version 1.0 hosted on JSFiddle.

I've slowly improved this application over the years due to not thinking about it until about a week before Christmas returns. Initially created as static html with data attributes & jQuery, I've since converted to a VueJS application utilizing localStorage.

There are a couple styling issues that need to be addressed before comfortably promoting to friends, but the functionality is there and keeps the little ones focused on this new game of "who opens next?".
