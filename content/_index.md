title: A Design Centric, Quality Focused, Front-End Engineer
---

I am a simplifier. I love making things easier for anyone I can help. Whether it’s an intuitive architecture for maintainable scalability, automating tasks for coworkers, simplifying content management for clients, or creating fast & pleasant experiences for users. Outside of work I find ways to simplify my wife’s daily tasks, researching solutions for my friends out of curiosity, or setting up technical devices for family to minimize complexities. At the core of what makes me an exceptional software engineer is the desire to help others by creating an enjoyable experience.

I am a design-centric developer focused on quality products that won't settle for “good enough”. I love working with great designers that can focus on their art, as they value my level of care and attention when bringing their designs to life. I’m proactive in implementing the look and feel that they’ve created across the site, resulting in less back-and-forth, less meetings, and a greater ROI for the business. I’m independently driven to get my work done and favor having a team to collaborate for advice with a new feature or tackling different obstacles on the same project for shared growth.
