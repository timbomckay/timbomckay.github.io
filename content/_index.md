I am a simplifier, I love making things easier for anyone I can help. Whether it’s an intuitive architecture to improve maintainability, automating tasks for coworkers, simplifying content management for clients, or creating fast & pleasant experiences for users. I even seek ways to simplify my wife’s daily tasks, researching solutions for my friends out of curiosity, or setting up technical devices for my parents to minimize complexities. At the core of what makes me an exceptional front-end engineer is the desire to help others by creating an enjoyable experience.

I am a design-centric developer focused on quality products, not settling for “good enough”. I love working with great designers that can focus on their art, and they enjoy working with me for my level of care and attention when bringing their designs to life. I’m proactive in implementing the look and feel that they’ve created across the site, resulting in less back-and-forth, less meetings, and a greater ROI for the business. I’m independently driven to get my work done and favor having a team to collaborate for advice with a new feature or tackling different obstacles on the same project.
