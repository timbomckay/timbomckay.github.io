Think of an article like the page of a well structured book.

## Best Practices:

* 8 - 12 words per line
* 40 - 70 characters per line
* Roughly 750px wide
* 1.2 - 1.5 Line Height
* 14 - 25px Font Size

## Small Fonts

* Used to fit more content in a section
* Typically used for data and quick reads
* Best for excerpts or snippets of info

## Large Fonts

* The "fold is gone. It doesn't matter anymore due to the wide range of window sizes from desktop to mobile. Users are more likely to scroll these days.
* Best used for headlines to grab attention and set priority
