I led a team in building this Fortune 10 company's entry into the world of online sales. Toyota Material Handling U.S.A. (TMHU) was the first division of Toyota Motors to sell directly to consumers while still appeasing their franchise dealers. Our team at Blackstone Media handled the user experience, partnering with another company who managed the SAP Hybris integration. Our design team created the interface while I led the development team in bringing it to life.

The shop was launched with only two variations of one model but was structured for growth as more products are added. This required a lot of research for me to learn various types of user authorization to decide which fit our needs and how to securely store the info. Created flow charts to uncover what data is needed when, at what point to require authorization. Utilizing Vuex for state management to keep all necessary data in sync across components.

**Highlights**

- Front-End Development
- VueJS
- E-Commerce
- User Authorization
- Chase Payment Gateway
