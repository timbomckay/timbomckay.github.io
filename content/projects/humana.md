I audited humana.com to provide feedback on ways to improve their performance. Providing ways to improve their Core Web Vitals with proper image sizes via responsive images, lazy-loading images below the threshold, and decreasing resource bloat with async components.

**Highlights**

- Response Images
- Core Web Vitals
- Lighthouse
- PageSpeed Insights
- WebPageTest
- Local Testing
