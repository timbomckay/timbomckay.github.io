On Christmas Eve 2014 my brother was contemplating a way to keep the kids attention when opening presents. When we go in order from youngest to oldest those under 10 are done and restless before the other half of the family gets through theirs. Determined to have a proof of concept to use the night of Christmas Day, my curiosity got the better of me as I stayed up until 5am to create Randomizr 1.0.

The initial concept was created on JSFiddle using data attributes and jQuery. Over the years it's slowly been enhanced, typically on Christmas Eve (as is tradition). It was converted to VueJS with localStorage shortly after its conception. Now I've recently converted it to Lit & Tailwind, saving 66.4% of JavaScript and 48.27% of CSS.

It's a fun passion project to iterate on each year that keeps the little ones focused on this game of _"who opens next?"_.
