Created a WordPress site to display a list of articles, defining a pattern for categories to be listed in the array with a conditional for filler tiles to complete the grid. Appending to the list using an AJAX loader to get more posts with the same pattern array, updating the url so the back & refresh buttons operate appropriately. Focused primarily on presenting the article as most visitors will be coming from the newsletter or social media straight to the article, designing a content-centered layout so the reader is free from distractions and a pleasant reading experience.
